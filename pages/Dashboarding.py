Building this app has been a useful learning experience
where I have learnt to use streamlit. Streamlit is often
used to create a simple user interface with several 
use cases these include:

- Dashboard for data

- API interaction

- Prototype machine learning models

There are lots of other use cases and streamlit is 
quite flexible.  

This page gives me a chance to demonstrate my ability
to deliver on some valuable use cases.
