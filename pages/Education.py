My dissertation was a data science project where I used
high-frequency stock market data to explore the viability 
of applying 'the signature' of a stock price path in a financial analysis
setting.

I initially performed dimensionality reduction before
applying a novel clustering algorithm to identify repeated patterns in
the shape of stock price movements.

I then used applied random forrest classification to price and volatility prediction
as well as identifying spurious stock price behaviour. Here I used the stock price signature 
to extract features for use in model building.
