    Snake is a well-known computer game and in this project I
    trained an agent to play this game using reinforcement
    learning methods. If you're unfamiliar with this game
    you can play it in a Google tab [here]({snake_google_url}).

    The inspiration for this project comes from my interest in reinforcement
    learning and passion for wasting time playing snake.

    This project can be viewed on my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/DanielBibby/Snake).
    
    I used Stable-baselines3, a reinforcement learning library in Python for this project where I created a custom 
    environment to implement the well-known game. I have limited resources available to me to train an agent, so this project aim is to create the best possible policy
    while limiting training to 1 million environment interactions. This is relatively few in a game like Snake where 
    food is sparse in the environment.
    s
    The following techniques are used:
    - Deep learning
    - Hyperparameter tuning 
    - Imitation learning
    - Model Selection
    - Reward engineering
    - State space manipulation
    
    I am currently wrapping this project up, currently I am implementing imitation learning as the final method.
