Building this app has been a useful learning experience
where that allowed me to learn to use streamlit. Streamlit is often
used to create a simple user interface with flexible 
use cases these include:

- Dashboard for data

- API interaction

- Prototype machine learning models

There are lots of other use cases and streamlit is 
a very useful tool for data scientists.

This page gives me a chance to demonstrate my ability
to deliver on some valuable uses of Streamlit.

I am also finishing the Snake project from ab ove right now, so check back here in a week so this page will be 
more built out in the following weeks.

#    In this example I will load data from
