    Snake is a well-known computer game and in this project I
    trained an agent to play this game using reinforcement
    learning methods. If you're unfamiliar with this game
    you can play it in a Google tab [here]({snake_google_url}).

    The inspiration for this project comes from my interest in reinforcement
    learning and passion for wasting time playing snake.

    Reinforcement learning (RL) is a way to teach a machine how to 
    effectively pick an **action** when interacting with the **environment** it 
    exists in to obtain a maximum **reward**s.
    
    The ideas of action, environment and reward vary depending on the situation
    problem being solved, for example:

    Efficient reinforcement learning depends on efficiently
    exploring an environment to find the best way to make
    decisions. 
    
    Within reason one can engineer the environment representation
    as I will demonstrate later. It is far easier to engineer the 
    reward function to optimise performance.

st.markdown("""
    The decision making part of RL is the **policy**. At a high level this can 
    be thought of as the brain of the **agent**. A policy will observe the state
    of the world it lives in and output an action believed to be best in some 
    sense.
    
    There are lots of different algorithms that can be used to extract value
    from experiences of the agent.
